    <p> This memory map shows some of my favourite locations I visited during my travels in 2019. Each icon has a number indicating the order I travelled to each location and can be clicked 
      for a description of my favourite part about visiting the location. Additionally, my favourite hike is also represented by a white polyline which can be viewed by zooming into 
      marker number 3, located in Scotland. </p>
